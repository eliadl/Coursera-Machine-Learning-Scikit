# Background

This repo builds on the work of

https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/Coursera-Machine-Learning

which implements Machine Learning exercises (Andrew Ng, Coursera) 

in python rather than Matlab/Octave. 

# Purpose

* Use scikit-learn to solve the exercises.
* Compare the solutions (sklearn vs. course implementation).
